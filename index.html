  <meta name="description" content="Hello, I'm a front-end developer specializing in Angular, the framework that impresses me every day. For several years I have been working in the digital market, developing various projects, even as a designer, which is another area I really enjoy. I also develop using PHP, including projects using the WordPress platform, building themes and plugins, but lately I have been focusing more on front-end, an area that I have always worked in but not as focused as now, finding in it many processes that I really enjoy working in. That's why I keep specializing more and more in the front-end area, and now focused on Angular.
